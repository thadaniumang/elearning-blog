<h2>Introduction to Discrete Mathematics</h2>
<div>
    Defining discrete mathematics is hard because defining mathematics is hard. <br>

<b>What is mathematics?</b> <br>
<p> 
    <i>The study of numbers?</i> In part, but you also study functions and lines and triangles and parallelepipeds and vectors and . . . . Or perhaps you want to say that mathematics is a collection of tools that allow you to solve problems. <br>
</p>
<b>What sort of problems?</b> <br> 
<p>
    Okay, those that involve numbers, functions, lines, triangles, . . . . Whatever your conception of what mathematics is, try applying the concept of <b>“discrete”</b> to it, as defined above. Some math fundamentally deals with stuff that is individually separate and distinct.

    In an algebra or calculus class, you might have found a particular set of numbers (maybe the set of numbers in the range of a function). You would represent this set as an interval: <i>[0, ∞) is the range of f (x) = x<sup>2</sup></i> since the set of outputs of the function are all real numbers 0 and greater. This set of numbers is NOT discrete. The numbers in the set are not separated by much at all. In fact, take any two numbers in the set and there are infinitely many more between them which are also in the set. Discrete math could still ask about the range of a function, but the set would not be an interval. Consider the function which gives the number of children of each person reading this. What is the range? I’m guessing it
    is something like <i>{0, 1, 2, 3}</i>. Maybe 4 is in there too. But certainly there is nobody reading this that has 1.32419 children. This output set is discrete because the elements are separate. The inputs to the function also form a discrete set because each input is an individual person.
